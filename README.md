# Lista-de-compras

Hallo,
This is a basic DOM exercise I got from "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Manipulating_documents#active_learning_a_dynamic_shopping_list"
Which I added and changed a few things, language included.
This is just for practice but the structure may be useful in the future.

Thanks for checking it.
